Processing files for Inelastic Scattering calculations with MCTDH

The following repository contains a set of routines and scripts that are useful to process inelastic scattering calculations with MCTDH.
They have already been used in at least 2 publications:
** Ndengué, S., Dawes, R., Gatti, F. and Meyer, H.D., 2017. Atom-triatom rigid rotor inelastic scattering with the MultiConfiguration Time Dependent Hartree approach. Chemical Physics Letters, 668, pp.42-46.
** Ndengué, S., Scribano, Y., Gatti, F. and Dawes, R., 2019. State-to-state inelastic rotational cross sections in five-atom systems with the multiconfiguration time dependent Hartree method. The Journal of chemical physics, 151(13), p.134301.

While these programs are open for usage, they may contain some errors in addition to the fact that they are relatively poorly documented.
If you intend to use it and potentially encountered some errors, please contact me at:
